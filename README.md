Components
As you can see we have an array of components that essentially make up the application 
-footer, header, and layout presents the styling aspect along with imports
-tasklist, taskitem, and taskinput are made for the base of the application (in order to create certian functions and aspects of the program)

Context
-applies the context of the task application 
-add, delete and viewing 
-this will finalize teh creation of the task functions in the home page

Pages
-is self explanatory this is the creation of the two interfaces (the pages which are home and about)

Styles
-we have made custom css made for each component that needs styling (whether it is colour, spacing or even alignments)
-the styling is there for specfic components in a specific way
